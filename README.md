**Loan Prediction Project — Python + Excel**

This project analyzes loan applicant data to understand approval patterns and identify key factors that influence loan status. It combines Python (data cleaning, EDA, model building) and Excel (summary tables + visuals) to create a complete end-to-end analysis workflow.

🚀 **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant characteristics such as income, education, loan amount, property area, credit history, etc.

This project demonstrates:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Insights & business interpretation

Supporting Excel analysis & dashboard

🛠️ **Tech Stack**

Languages & Tools:

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Jupyter Notebook

Excel (Pivot tables, Charts, XLOOKUP)

🔧 **Steps Performed**
1. Data Cleaning

Filled missing values for numerical & categorical variables

Standardized formats

Removed unnecessary columns

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Distribution of loan amounts, incomes, credit history

Relationship between features & loan approval

Visual charts created using Excel

3. Feature Engineering

Encoded categorical variables

Created new variables like total income

Scaled numeric features

4. Model Building

Train-test split

Trained Logistic Regression / Random Forest

Evaluated accuracy 

5. Business Insights

Applicants with good credit history have a high approval probability

Higher total income increases the chances of approval

Self-employed status has a minimal effect

Loan amount and property area impact approval decisions

📊 **Excel Dashboard Highlights**

The Excel file includes:

Loan approval summary

Income category analysis

Credit history analysis

Pivot tables for segmentation

Clean & interactive graphs

🎯 **Key Learnings**

How to clean real-world messy datasets

Combining Excel analytics with Python modelling

Understanding what drives loan approvals

End-to-end project implementation skills
